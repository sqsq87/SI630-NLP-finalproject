This is my final project of course 'Natural language Processing' on Detecting Spam on Yelp
I have trained different machine learning models to detect the characteristics of spams. 
The whole process of the project can be seen in 'Using Natural Language Processing to find deceptive spams on the review websites _ by Qi Sun _ Apr, 2021 _ Medium.pdf'.
